Email Checker

This simple program takes an email address and attempts to verify that it is valid.

It is primarily for (self-)educational purposes and should not be used as an alternative to JavaMail.

The check will try both a "RCPT TO" and "VRFY" command. The latter is blocked/unimplemented on most servers, but some will still accept it.
